## Caveats:
* No binaries exist yet for this program; it must be compiled from source.
* On GNU/Linux systems, Wine has to be used, since OpenTK 3.x doesn't yet support .NET Core.
* After compilation, the runtime libraries need to be placed from 'runtime' to the output directory for the program to run correctly.
